# Generation 3: Stone-Chain Potential Shaping (FAILED)

**Date:** [DATE REMOVED]  
**Status:** ‚ùå FAILED - Regression from Gen-2  
**Final Score:** 3.82% (Target: >4.00%)  
**Baseline:** Gen-2 (4.00%)

---

## üéØ Objective

Build upon Gen-2's action masking success by adding **targeted potential-based reward shaping** focused on the wood‚Üístone‚Üístone pickaxe progression chain to accelerate early-game learning while maintaining policy invariance.

---

## üî¨ Approach: Stone-Chain Potential Shaping

### Core Innovation
Implemented **policy-invariant potential-based shaping** using a œÜ-function that rewards progress through the critical stone tool chain:

```
Œ¶(s) = {
    0.3  if has wood pickaxe
    0.5  if has stone (requires wood pickaxe)
    1.0  if has stone pickaxe (requires both)
}

Shaping reward: F(s, s') = Œª[Œ≥Œ¶(s') - Œ¶(s)]
```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Training-Only Shaping**
   - Applied only during training (1M steps)
   - Disabled during evaluation to maintain fair comparison
   - Prevents evaluation bias from shaped rewards

2. **Decay Schedule**
   - Active: Steps 300K-700K (30%-70% of training)
   - Early start after exploration phase
   - Early termination to allow unguided refinement

3. **Conservative Parameters**
   - Œª = 0.10 (low magnitude, 10% of intrinsic rewards)
   - Potential range: 0.0-1.0
   - Max shaping per step: ¬±0.10

4. **Chain Selection Rationale**
   - Wood pickaxe ‚Üí Stone collection ‚Üí Stone pickaxe
   - High-value progression (0% ‚Üí 1% ‚Üí 0% baseline rates)
   - Bottleneck for all advanced content

### Technical Implementation

```python
class StonePotentialShapingWrapper(gym.Wrapper):
    LAMBDA = 0.10
    DECAY_START = 0.30
    DECAY_END = 0.70
    
    def potential(self, inventory):
        if inventory['stone_pickaxe'] > 0:
            return 1.0
        elif inventory['stone'] > 0:
            return 0.5
        elif inventory['wood_pickaxe'] > 0:
            return 0.3
        return 0.0
```

## üîç Analysis: Mixed Results

### Successes: Stone Chain Partially Unlocked! üéâ

1. **Wood Pickaxe Breakthrough**: 3% ‚Üí 7.19% (+140% improvement!)
   - Shaping successfully guided agents toward wood pickaxe crafting
   - More than doubled the rate from Gen-2

2. **Stone Pickaxe First Achievement**: 0% ‚Üí 0.04%
   - **FIRST GENERATION TO CRAFT STONE PICKAXE!**
   - Small but significant breakthrough (2-3 agents out of 5704 episodes)
   - Proves stone chain is learnable with proper guidance

3. **Coal Collection Unlocked**: 0% ‚Üí 0.18%
   - Secondary benefit from stone pickaxe crafting
   - Opens path to iron tools (future generations)

### Failures: Why Overall Score Declined

1. **Geometric Mean Penalty**
   - Crafter score uses geometric mean of all achievements
   - Improvements in rare achievements (pickaxe, coal) have minimal impact
   - Need improvements across MANY achievements to raise score

2. **Stone Collection Slight Regression**
   - 1.33% ‚Üí 0.84% (-37% relative decline)
   - Possibly agents focused on crafting vs raw collection
   - Action masking might have shifted strategy

3. **Average Reward Decline**
   - 4.09 ‚Üí 3.63 (-11% decline)
   - Suggests shaping may have distracted from other valuable behaviors
   - Training-only shaping still affected learned policy

4. **Single-Chain Focus Too Narrow**
   - Focused only on wood‚Üístone‚Üístone pickaxe
   - Didn't improve other high-value chains (iron, combat, food)
   - Need broader reward structure for score improvement

## üí° Lessons Learned

### What Worked ‚úÖ
1. **Targeted shaping CAN unlock compositional skills**:
   - Wood pickaxe: +140% (3% ‚Üí 7.19%)
   - Stone pickaxe: FIRST EVER (0% ‚Üí 0.04%)
   - Coal collection: FIRST EVER (0% ‚Üí 0.18%)

2. **Policy-invariant design mathematically sound**
3. **Training-only application (no evaluation bias)**
4. **Clean wrapper implementation**

### What Didn't Work ‚ùå
1. **Overall score declined despite target improvements**
   - Geometric mean punishes single-chain focus
   - Need broad improvements, not narrow breakthroughs

2. **Conservative shaping magnitude**
   - Œª=0.10 sufficient for target chain but didn't prevent other regressions
   - Possible distraction effect on other valuable behaviors

3. **Single-chain focus too narrow**
   - Crafter requires balanced skill development
   - Stone chain alone insufficient for score improvement

### Key Insights üîë
- **Success paradox**: Achieved technical goal (stone pickaxe) but failed score goal
- **Crafter's scoring**: Geometric mean requires BROAD improvements, not DEEP ones
- **Shaping effectiveness**: Œª=0.10 DID work for target chain (+140% wood pickaxe!)
- **Strategic lesson**: Need multi-chain or curriculum approach, not single-chain focus

## üöÄ Recommendations for Gen-4

### Revised Understanding
Gen-3 **succeeded at technical goal** (unlocked stone pickaxe) but **failed at score goal** because Crafter's geometric mean scoring requires BROAD improvements across many achievements, not DEEP improvement in one chain.

### Option A: Multi-Chain Curriculum Shaping (RECOMMENDED)
- Base: Gen-2 (Gen-1 + Action Masking)
- Addition: Broader shaping across multiple valuable chains:
  - Wood chain (tools, table, combat)
  - Stone chain (pickaxe, furnace)
  - Food chain (eating, farming)
  - Combat chain (zombies, skeletons)
- Sequential curriculum: unlock chains progressively
- Expected: 4.3-4.8% (+8-20% improvement)
- Rationale: Address geometric mean by improving MANY achievements

### Option B: Extended Episode Timeout
- Base: Gen-2 (Gen-1 + Action Masking)
- Addition: Increase max_episode_steps from 10,000 ‚Üí 20,000
- Pure hyperparameter change
- Expected: 4.2-4.5% (+5-13% improvement)
- Risk: **VERY LOW**
- Rationale: More time = more achievements per episode

### Option C: Curiosity-Based Exploration (RND/ICM)
- Base: Gen-2 (Gen-1 + Action Masking)
- Addition: Intrinsic motivation for exploration
- Expected: 4.3-4.8% (+8-20% improvement)
- Risk: **MEDIUM** (complex but proven)
- Rationale: Encourage diverse achievement discovery

### Priority Recommendation
**Option B (Extended Timeout)** - lowest risk, addresses geometric mean by allowing more achievements per episode, fast turnaround.

## üéì Conclusion

Gen-3's **stone-chain potential shaping** approach achieved a **technical success** but **strategic failure**:

**‚úÖ Technical Success:**
- Wood pickaxe: 3% ‚Üí 7.19% (+140% improvement!)
- Stone pickaxe: 0% ‚Üí 0.04% (**FIRST GENERATION TO ACHIEVE THIS!**)
- Coal collection: 0% ‚Üí 0.18% (**FIRST GENERATION TO ACHIEVE THIS!**)

**‚ùå Strategic Failure:**
- Overall Crafter Score: 4.00% ‚Üí 3.82% (-4.5% decline)
- Reason: Geometric mean scoring requires BROAD improvements, not DEEP single-chain focus
- Single-chain shaping insufficient for overall score improvement

**Key Learning:** In Crafter, unlocking hard achievements (stone pickaxe) matters less than improving many achievements uniformly. The geometric mean scoring heavily penalizes specialization.

**Next Steps:** Gen-4 should use **extended episode timeout** (lowest risk) or **multi-chain curriculum shaping** (broader impact) to address geometric mean requirement.

**Generation Status**: ‚ùå **FAILED** (score decline) but ‚≠ê **BREAKTHROUGH** (first stone pickaxe/coal)
